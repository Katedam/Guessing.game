# Guessing Game
This game has is called Two Truths and a Lie. When the user clicks the button, the game begins. It has three questions with text input boxes. The user inputs their answer and an alert lets them know if it's right or wrong. At the end of the game, an alert tells them how many questions they got right.

# Random Number Guessing Game
When the user clicks the button for this game, it begins. A random number is generated and the user must guess by typing the number into the text prompt. The prompt loops until the user guesses the right number. Each time they guess incorrectly, they receive and alert that says if their guess is too low or too high. Once they guess correctly, the user is alerted that they have guessed correctly and the game ends.
