# Alchemy Code Lab * Bootcamp Part 1 * Project 1

# Made a web page about myself that includes:
* A photo gallery
* Facts about me
* A guessing game about me
* A game to guess what's growing in my garden
* A random number guessing game


# Photo Gallery
I used margin, width, height, border and float properties to align the photos into a line across the top of the page.

# Guessing Game
This game is called Two Truths and a Lie. For each question, the user can choose between truth or lie buttons. Once clicked, the user will see either "Right" or "Wrong" appear on the screen below the question. 

# Veggie Guessing Game
This game has 7 possible right answers held in an array. When the user clicks the button, a prompt allows the user to guess by typing the name of a vegetable. If the vegetable is not in the array, the user recieves a message in the browser telling them to try again. If they guess one correctly, they recieve a similar message in the browser saying they guessed correctly. They may click the button again to guess as many times as they want. 

# Random Number Guessing Game
When the user clicks the button for this game, it begins. A random number is generated and the user must guess by typing the number into the text prompt. The prompt loops until the user guesses the right number. Each time they guess incorrectly, they receive an alert that says if their guess is too low or too high. Once they guess correctly, the user is alerted that they have guessed correctly and the game ends.

# CSS
* I used the value 'linear-gradient' with a 35 degree angle and 3 colors to style the background. 
* I used float and margin properties for the layout.
* I used width, height and border-radius properties to shape the elements into circles and rounded corners.
* I used class and ID selectors coupled with element selectors to style answer responses to the games.
